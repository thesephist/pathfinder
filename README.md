# Pathfinder

Pathfinder is a small text-based in-browser game built on BackboneJS

## Storyline

The narrative arc of the story follows a small character, Remi, as he discovers a world beyond his perceived reality through navigating a dreamlike world, lead by his long-lost friend Aurelia.

The game is played through issuing text-based commands and asking questions, navigating a world of a labyrinth of rooms filled with interesting objects. While the primary objective of the game is merely to explore, in the process, the player finds answers to seemingly unanswerable questions about life and death within the labyrinth.

## Construction

The user interface of the game is built on BackboneJS, while a custom storyline script serves as the server and backend for the game. 

BackboneJS models and views are completely responsible for serving up user interface elements for the entire game, from scene changes to delivering and accepting user input.

The storyline script accepts natural language input and interprets it with a database of narrative elements and the gameworld to offer replies, narrations, and other elements to expand the player's knowledge of the gameworld.
